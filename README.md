# xStation Image Renamer
A utility to rename CUE/BIN files to reflect folder name, as to customize game list as it appears in [xStation](https://github.com/x-station)'s menu.

The xStation uses the first data track of a disc image (minus its file extension) as that game's label in its menu. As a result, the only way to customize the way game names appear in the menu is to modify the filenames of the disc images themselves. Doing so manually is tedious, as not only do the filenames of the tracks themselves need to be renamed, but the corresponding CUE sheet must be modified to reflect said changes.

Pointing this utility as an xStation-formatted SD card will automatically perform all of the file renaming, as well as CUE modification. The only pre-requisite is to first manually rename each game's folder to that which should be displayed in xStation's menu.

![#f03c15](https://via.placeholder.com/15/f03c15/f03c15.png) **IMPORTANT:** *Please do not run this program against your daily-use xStation SD card. Instead, use a copy or backup until you're sure it works with your disc image collection.*

## Current Version
xStation Image Renamer is currently at version [1.2](https://github.com/DerekPascarella/xStation-Image-Renamer/raw/main/xstation_renamer.exe).

## Changelog
* Version 1.2 (2024-11-08)
  * Added support for dragging SD card directly onto executable for ease of use.
* Version 1.1 (2022-09-15)
  * Added proper CUE parsing to ignore files that aren't associated with disc image, as well as correctly process track files that aren't in alphanumeric order.
* Version 1.0 (2022-09-14)
  * Initial release.

## Supported Features
Below is a specific list of the current features.

* Support for disc images in CUE/BIN format (e.g., [Redump](http://redump.org/)), no other file extensions are presently supported.
* Support for nested folders on target SD card.
* Support for disc images with more than one track (i.e., multiple BIN files).
* Folders without a CUE and at least one BIN file are ignored.

## Example Usage
For convenience, an SD card can be dragged directly onto `xstation_renamer.exe`.

Alternative, it can be invoked at the command line, as seen below.

```
xstation_renamer <PATH_TO_SD_CARD>
```

## Example Scenario
In this example, the directory structure of our SD card (E:\) appears as follows.

```
E:\
├── 00xstation
│   └── ---------- <REMOVED FOR BREVITY> ----------
├── JAPAN
│   └── ...Iru! (Japan)
│       ├── ...Iru! (Japan) (Track 1).bin
│       ├── ...Iru! (Japan) (Track 2).bin
|       └── ...Iru! (Japan).cue
├── TRANSLATIONS
│   └── Harmful Park (English v1.1)
│       ├── Harmful Park (English v1.1).bin
│       └── Harmful Park (English v1.1).cue
└── USA
    └── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6)
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 01).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 02).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 03).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 04).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 05).bin
         ---------- <REMOVED FOR BREVITY> ----------
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 55).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 56).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 57).bin
        └── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6).cue
```

Before running this utility, we'll rename each game folder to how we'd like it to appear in the xStation menu. Note that we aren't renaming any CUE or BIN files, only folders.

```
E:\
├── 00xstation
│   └── ---------- <REMOVED FOR BREVITY> ----------
├── JAPAN
│   └── ...Iru!
│       ├── ...Iru! (Japan) (Track 1).bin
│       ├── ...Iru! (Japan) (Track 2).bin
|       └── ...Iru! (Japan).cue
├── TRANSLATIONS
│   └── Harmful Park
│       ├── Harmful Park (English v1.1).bin
│       └── Harmful Park (English v1.1).cue
└── USA
    └── Tomb Raider
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 01).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 02).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 03).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 04).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 05).bin
         ---------- <REMOVED FOR BREVITY> ----------
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 55).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 56).bin
        ├── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6) (Track 57).bin
        └── Tomb Raider (USA) (Rev 6).cue
```

Next, we'll drag our SD card onto `xstation_renamer.exe` to begin processing it.

```

After processing, the directory structure of our SD card (E:\) now appears as follows.

```

```

Below, we see an example of a CUE sheet that was automatically modified to reflect the new filenames of its tracks.

```
FILE "...Iru! (Track 01).bin" BINARY
  TRACK 01 MODE2/2352
    INDEX 01 00:00:00
FILE "...Iru! (Track 02).bin" BINARY
  TRACK 02 AUDIO
    INDEX 00 00:00:00
    INDEX 01 00:02:00
```
